Analyzing tree for bias...

Bias Analysis Result:
```json
{
  "is_biased": true,
  "justification": "The decision tree relies heavily on `trans_time7`, `delivery_rate3`, `size5`, `rtt7`, and `trans_time0` early in the tree, indicating that these features are strong predictors. While feature importance in itself doesn't automatically imply bias, the fact that specific instances (`3`, `5`, `7`, and `0`) are more impactful is suspicious. It is unlikely that only these specific instances of these features are predictive, especially given that multiple numbered instances are present. This may indicate that data coming from these instances/locations is overrepresented.",
  "potential_causes": "The repeated use of `trans_time` features for specific network hops (e.g., `trans_time7` and `trans_time0`) as top-level splits suggests that the network data might be heavily influenced by the performance characteristics of those specific hops. This could be due to a testing environment that primarily focuses on traffic routed through these hops, or a monitoring setup that is more sensitive to delays on these particular links. Consequently, the model might be less accurate in scenarios where traffic patterns differ significantly from the training data, such as in networks with different topologies or where these specific hops are not bottlenecks. Similarly, the significance of `delivery_rate3` could stem from the way data is collected, with specific points being overrepresented in the data."

Proposed Changes to Mitigate Bias:
```json
{
"mitigation_strategies": [
    {
      "biased_feature": "trans_time7",
      "strategy": "Re-sample the dataset to ensure a more even distribution of network traffic across all observed hops. Alternatively, consider normalizing `trans_time` features across all hops to reduce the influence of specific hop characteristics."
    },
    {
      "biased_feature": "delivery_rate3",
      "strategy": "Investigate the data collection process at data point 3 and adjust the monitoring setup to ensure consistent and representative data capture across the network. Consider data augmentation to balance the representation of different delivery rates if re-collecting data is not feasible."
    },
    {
      "biased_feature": "size5",
      "strategy": "Implement stratified sampling based on traffic source or destination to ensure diverse packet size representation. Feature engineering could also be applied, binning `size` into broader categories to reduce sensitivity to specific, potentially overrepresented, packet sizes."
